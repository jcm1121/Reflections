What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
it creates a .git directory..  git uses it to store history and commits.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
it stores only the files you wish to commit from the working directory, then when committed, the entire set of files in the 
staging directory are added to the repository under the commit...
