How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a
commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google
docs does?

    
You get to pick the logical place to commit.

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple 
files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?

    
Many times there are multiple files that support a project and they all change.  Committing multiple files allows the changes across the files to be seenn.



How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?

    
they are used to display the list of commits (log) and show the differences between two commits (diff)



How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that
